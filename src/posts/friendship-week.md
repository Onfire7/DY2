title: Friendship Week!
description: Next week is Friendship Week (February 3rd-7th), and we have some
  exciting activities planned to celebrate the power of friendship!  On Tuesday,
  we’ll be kicking things off with a Giving Tree, where we’ll work together to
  spread kindness and generosity. Later in the week, we’ll be creating a
  Friendship Banner to hang in our space as a reminder of the bonds we
  share.  It’s going to be a week filled with fun, love, and learning about the
  importance of caring for one another. We can’t wait to celebrate with all our
  little friends!
