This week was packed with fun and learning as we welcomed two very special guests to the daycare - Rolly the Clown and the Science Lady! Rolly had everyone giggling with his silly tricks, colorful balloons, and playful antics that brought tons of laughter to the room. Then the Science Lady wowed us with exciting experiments that sparked curiosity in every child. It was a perfect blend of entertainment and education, and the kids havenâ€™t stopped talking about it since!
