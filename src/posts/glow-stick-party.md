This week at the Discovery Years, we had an absolute blast with a glowstick party! The kids lit up the room with colorful glowsticks, dancing, laughing, and enjoying the glowing fun. To keep the creativity flowing, we also dove into some exciting art projects—painting, crafting, and using all kinds of textures and colors to make their imaginations come to life. It was a fun-filled day of movement, color, and creativity, and we loved seeing all the bright smiles (and glowing bracelets) around the room!
