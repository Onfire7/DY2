Join us for a fun and festive **Valentine's Day Party** on **Friday, February 14th**. We'll be celebrating with treats, crafts, and lots of heart-filled fun! Please be sure to bring a box of Valentines for your child's class by Monday, Feb. 10th! The kids will be writing their own names on the Valentine cards with help from the teacher. Parents can sign up to bring food for the party, on a list by the front door.

Be sure to send your little one in with their best Valentine's spirit â€“ we can't wait to share the love with everyone!
