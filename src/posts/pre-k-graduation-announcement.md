We’re so excited to announce that our **Pre-K Graduation Ceremony** will be held on **Thursday, May 29th, from 7:00 to 8:00 PM**!

Join us as we celebrate our little graduates and all the amazing things they’ve accomplished this year. It’s a special milestone, and we can’t wait to share it with our wonderful daycare families.

**After the ceremony**, stick around for pizza and beverages as we continue the celebration together!

**Important Note:** Please bring a folding chair for your comfort during the event.

We look forward to seeing everyone there for an evening of joy, pride, and a few happy tears!
