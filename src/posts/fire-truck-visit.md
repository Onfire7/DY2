We had an exciting visit at the daycare this weekâ€”a real firetruck came by! The children were thrilled to meet the firefighters, explore the truck up close, and even sit in the a fireman's seat. The crew talked about fire safety in a fun and engaging way, answering lots of curious questions from our little learners. It was a memorable experience that sparked big imaginations and even bigger smiles!
