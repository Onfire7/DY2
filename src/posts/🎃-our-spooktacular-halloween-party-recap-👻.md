Halloween is one of our favorite times of the year, and this year’s celebration was full of laughter, creativity, and just the right amount of spooky fun!

From the moment our little ghosts, superheroes, and princesses walked through the door, the excitement was contagious. The children proudly showed off their costumes, everything from dinosaurs to doctors, and we loved seeing the imagination and confidence behind each one.

We kicked off the morning with a costume parade around the center, where the kids waved to their friends and teachers while showing off their festive outfits. Each class worked on a special Halloween art project, and the results were adorable!

We want to send a big thank you to our families for helping with costumes, treats, and supplies, and to our wonderful teachers for making everything run so smoothly. These moments of joy, imagination, and community are what make Discovery Years so special.

We’re already looking forward to next year’s Halloween celebration, but until then we’ll be enjoying the memories!

Happy Halloween from all of us at Discovery Years! 🎃🧡
